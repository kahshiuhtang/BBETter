# NBA Sports Betting 

## Description

Attempt to use ML techniques predict what are the best sports bets to take.

## Pipeline

1) User enters in a sports bet (or multiple)

2) User chooses a model 

3) Model runs and returns the percentage of bet hitting

4) Calculate the expected value of parlay or bet

5) Show the user

## Training Pipeline

1) Pull data from NBA data site

2) Train model on the new data

3) Update the model used for user pipeline

## Website Features

* Visualization of old data

* Receiving Sports Bet Probability

## Models

Some models I have interest in looking into

* LogReg

* RandomForest

* GBM

* PCA

* GAN

There should be two problems the models should model

1) Given a player, player_team and opp_team, predict the player's stats

2) Given a matchup (team vs. team), give a final score prediction
